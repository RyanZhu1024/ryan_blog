This page lets you create HTML by entering text in a simple format that's easy to read and write.

  - Type Markdown text in the left window
  - See the HTML in the right

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

```ruby
    def render_markdown(content)
        require 'redcarpet'
        renderer = PygmentizeHTML
        extensions = {
            fenced_code_blocks:true,
            autolink:true,
            hard_wrap:true,
            filter_html:true,
            no_intra_emphasis:true,
            gh_blockcode:true
        }
        redcarpet = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(renderer, extensions)
        redcarpet.render content.html_safe
    end

    class PygmentizeHTML < Redcarpet::Render::HTML
        def block_code(code, language)
            require 'pygmentize'
            Pygmentize.highlight(code, :lexer => language,
            :options => {:linenos => true}
            )
        end
