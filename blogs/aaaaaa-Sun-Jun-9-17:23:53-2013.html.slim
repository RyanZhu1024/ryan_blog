	  - See the HTML in the right

	Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

	> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
	> formatting syntax is to make it as readable 
	> as possible. The idea is that a
	> Markdown-formatted document should be
	> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
	> looking like it's been marked up with tags
	> or formatting instructions.
